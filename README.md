# Boston Housing
For this assignment, I will be using the Boston Housing Prices Data Set.

I performed some basic descriptive statistics to get a sense of data following by using tools such as Nearest neighbour , cross validation and forward selection to select the features that best predict the housing prices.

I wrote all the algorithms from scratch , instead of using standard Python libraries such as SciPy.

This was a part of the INFX-574 course at the University of Washington.
